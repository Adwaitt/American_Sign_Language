# American_Sign_Language (ASL)
This repo consists of a CNN that could detect the ASL. This repo also incorporates the use of the edge detection algorithm and transfer learning using tensorflow and Keras framework, using the VGG16 imagenet with a validation accuracy of 96%. I also had blurred some images and some images from my dataset quite blurred and have uploaded that altered dataset too
